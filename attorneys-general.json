He continued to protect victims through his work in the U.S\nCongress, where he received numerous awards from victim rights organizations.\nAnd, as Ohio lieutenant governor, DeWine worked to reform our parole system so\nthat violent offenders remained locked up.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, I promoted the emerging DNA technology, establishing and expanding a truly national database for DNA, fingerprint, and ballistics information, so that violent offenders -- no matter where they traveled -- could be caught and\nprosecuted.” DeWine specifically targeted funds to Ohio’s crime lab -- the\nBureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation -- to keep our families\nsafer.\n\nWhile others were on the sidelines, Mike DeWine has, for over 30 years, fought to\nprotect the unborn. He was one of a handful of U.S. senators to lead the charge\nto ban the horrific partial-birth abortion practice. DeWine wrote and pushed\nfor passage of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which for the first time,\ncreated a federal law recognizing that an unborn child is a separate victim\nwhen the mother is attacked. And, he wrote the “DeWine Amendment” each Congress to prohibit federal tax dollars from being used to pay for insurance to provide abortion coverage.\n\nMichael DeWine was born on Jan. 5, 1947, in Springfield, Ohio, and grew up in Yellow Springs. He married his high school sweetheart Frances Struewing while both\nwere students at Miami University. After graduating from Miami, DeWine attended\nOhio Northern Law School, and was awarded his Juris Doctorate degree in 1972.\nThe DeWines have resided in Cedarville Township, Ohio since Mike graduated from\nlaw school. They attend St. Paul’s Catholic Church and are the parents of eight\nchildren: Patrick, Jill, Rebecca, John, Brian, Alice, Mark, and Anna. Fran and\nMike are now the grandparents of 15 grandchildren.",

His mother and father taught him, as well as his three brothers, the importance of honesty, community and hard work at an early age.\n\nAfter graduating from Tolman High School, Kilmartin decided that he wanted to protect and serve the community in which he grew up. In 1984, Attorney General Kilmartin enrolled in the police academy, and for 24 years, served his community as a member of the Pawtucket Police Department, starting as an officer on patrol, working his way up to becoming the officer in charge of prosecutions and retiring as a Captain.\n\nKilmartin earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Roger Williams University, and later earned his Juris Doctorate at Roger Williams University School of Law. \n\nAs a police officer, Kilmartin knew that he didn’t just want to protect the public, he wanted to be their advocate. He decided to run for state representative, and at the State House he fought to further the protection of Rhode Islanders for nearly 20 years.\n\nAs a state representative, Attorney General Kilmartin helped pass laws to protect children from predators, create a witness protection program, ban texting while driving, keep alcohol out of cars, put an end to pension abuses, strengthen domestic violence penalties and force health insurance companies to cover reconstructive surgery for women following breast cancer mastectomies.\n\nRecognizing his devotion to fighting for the protection of every day Rhode Islanders, Kilmartin received numerous public service awards from a wide array of groups, including: Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), After-School Alliance Plus, Justice Assistance, the Boys and Girls Club, Gateway Health Care and the Northern Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSince being elected Attorney General, Kilmartin has continued to put Rhode Islanders’ safety and security as his number one priority. Kilmartin has strongly advocated for longer prison sentences and stiffer penalties for those who commit crimes. He successfully changed the state’s “Good Time” law, prohibiting those who commit heinous crimes against children to earn time off for good behavior while incarcerated. He has advocated for stronger stiffer sentences for those who illegally possess and use firearms, as well as those who engage in gang activity. \n\nKilmartin has established specialized prosecution units that specialize in specific crimes and victims, including a Veteran’s Court with the goal of successfully rehabilitating veterans by diverting them from the traditional criminal justice system and providing them the tools they will need to lead a productive, law-abiding life. In addition, Kilmartin established a Child Abuse Unit, led by prosecutors, victim advocates and support staff, all trained to handle the emotional and psychological effects associated with physical and sexual abuse of children. He has been a leader in updating the state’s Internet safety laws, protecting children from online predators, and was the architect of the 2012 changes to the state’s Access to Public Records Act. \n\nKilmartin serves in several leadership positions with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), including liaison to the International Association of Prosecutors, chair for NAAG’s Eastern Region, co-chair for NAAG’s Consumer Protection Committee, and serves on the Criminal Law Committee, the Law Enforcement and Prosecutorial Relations Working Group, and Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nKilmartin and his wife, Kristine, are actively involved in the community. Together, they founded the Pawtucket Arts Festival in 1999, which draws thousands of people from all across Southern New England to Pawtucket every year, serving as an economic and cultural boon to the Rhode Island economy.",

        "twitterHandle": "Sean Reyes is the 21st attorney general for the state of Utah. In what has been coined a landslide victory, General Reyes received over 60 percent of the vote in the 2014 general election. On Jan. 5, 2014, at age 42, Reyes took the oath of office once again under officiator and Utah Supreme Court Associate Justice Thomas R. Lee. During his culturally diverse inauguration ceremony and speech, Reyes reaffirmed the Utah Attorney General’s Office (“AGO”) focus on returning to being a law office and not a political one; and on legal excellence, professionalism, and the AGO’s priority to defend the citizens, businesses and laws of Utah.\n\nRESTORING PUBLIC TRUST\nIn just one year, Reyes has won back confidence in his office from leaders in politics, education, business, law and, most importantly, from Utah citizens. In the first months of his administration, by commissioning outside investigations and audits to shine a light on even the possibility of misconduct in the AGO, streamline budgets and expenditures, and improve infrastructure and client satisfaction, Reyes quickly reestablished credibility at the highest ranks of the office with an outstanding 90 percent client satisfaction audit result last fall. \n\nWIDE SPREAD SUPPORT\nThe AGO, under the Reyes Administration, has the support of mayors, councilmen and commissioners state wide and critical law enforcement relationships have been repaired with sheriffs, police chiefs and federal partners like ICE and the DEA. Among his peers in the legal community, Reyes has been applauded by county attorneys, judges and lawyers for focusing his office on the rule of law and not political agendas or special interests. \n\nCASES OF NATIONAL INTEREST\nAt the time of his first inauguration, several cases of national interest, including those regarding the definition of marriage, polygamy and immigration were awaiting his direction and leadership. While very emotional and potentially divisive in nature, Reyes has approached each case with the same sense of dignity, professionalism, exceptionalism, duty and respect that won him numerous awards and recognitions throughout his legal career including being named first-ever National Outstanding Young Lawyer by the ABA, a distinction bestowed on one lawyer out of millions nationwide. Along with many upgrades to infrastructure, technology and efficiencies to make his legal teams even better, he organized a Constitutional Law Section to support the Utah AGO with many of the critical issues it has already faced and is likely to face in the near future. \n\nPOLITICAL SERVICE AT ALL LEVELS\nIn addition to his legal career and volunteer service, Reyes has been very involved in Utah politics. He has served as a county, state and national delegate for the Republican Party and a member of the State Central Committee (the governing body of the Utah Republican Party). He served several terms as a leader in his local precinct and was appointed by Governor John M. Huntsman and re-appointed by Governor Gary R. Herbert to serve as one of the youngest members of the prestigious Third District Judicial Nominating Commission. He spent several years on a National Congressional Commission started by President George W. Bush. Appointed by Congress and the president of the United States, Reyes conducted public hearings throughout the country to advise the Administration and Congress on Latino issues, including a National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nFAMILY MATTERS\nReyes and his wife, Saysha, are the proud parents of six children between the ages of four and 16. In his free time, he enjoys playing morning basketball, coaching his kids in youth football, baseball, basketball, volleyball and soccer, taking walks or doing anything with Saysha, watching Sports Center, attending and speaking at Comic Cons, as well as cooking, shooting guns and watching mixed martial arts (now that his fighting days are over).",
