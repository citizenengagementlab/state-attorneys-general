Walnut, Des Moines, IA 50319",(515) 281-5164,http://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov,"Tom Miller is serving in his ninth four-year term as attorney general of Iowa.

He was born Aug. 11, 1944, in Dubuque, Iowa, the son of the late Elmer and Betty Miller. Tom grew up in Dubuque, where his father was the longtime county assessor and an inspiration for Tom's early interest in public service. Tom graduated from Wahlert High School in 1962 and Loras College in 1966, and he received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1969.

After law school, Tom served as a VISTA volunteer in Baltimore, Md.,for two years, and then as legislative assistant to U.S. Representative John C. Culver (D-IA.) He returned to the Baltimore Legal Aid Bureau as legal education director, and he also taught part-time at the Maryland School of Law. In 1973, Tom returned to live in Iowa. He opened a law practice in McGregor in northeast Iowa and served as city attorney of McGregor and Marquette, Iowa. He ran for attorney general in 1974.

Tom has served as attorney general of Iowa since he was first elected in 1978, except for four years when he was in private practice as a partner at the Des Moines office of the Faegre & Benson Law Firm (1991-94.)

Attorney General Tom Miller has earned a reputation for integrity, high quality legal work, and strong work on behalf of ordinary Iowans. He has a long record of achieving results through cooperation with other state attorneys general and with local, state and federal officials, regardless of their political affiliation. He has served as president of the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) and received NAAG's Wyman Award as the attorney general who contributed most to NAAG and its members. He has chaired several NAAG committees and led major multi-state working groups working on tobacco issues, antitrust enforcement, agriculture, and consumer protection.

Tom is well known for his work to prevent crime and assist crime victims, to protect consumers, and to be an advocate for farmers:

Fighting crime has always been one of his top priorities. The Attorney General's Office continues its strong record handling many of the state's most important and difficult criminal prosecutions and arguing all of the state's criminal appeals before the Iowa Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. Tom and his office also have focused on fighting juvenile crime and working for improvements in the juvenile justice system. The office also provides extensive assistance to victims of crime, including crime victim compensation and support for local programs that aid victims.

Protecting consumers is one of Tom Miller's highest priorities. His office pioneered the undercover telephone 'sting' that sharply reduced telemarketing crime that cheated older Iowans and people all over the nation. He tackled the issue of questionable sweepstakes that prey on senior citizens, and his office has helped tens of thousands of Iowans with problems ranging from automobile complaints to telemarketing abuse and charity fraud. His office also has organized projects to protect small businesses from consumer fraud.

Working for farmers has always been a mission for Attorney General Miller, who established the nation's first Farm Division in an attorney general's office when he took office in 1978. The Farm Division has led the way in successful cases against agricultural chemical companies, helped hundreds of farmers get a fair shake from a huge pipeline project cutting across their farmland, led a group of states insisting on compensation to farmers and elevators who suffer losses resulting from StarLink genetically modified corn, and pushed for laws to protect farmers who enter contracts with large agribusinesses.

And Tom Miller is fighting for kids and taxpayers as he continues the campaign to reduce the enormous death toll and financial costs of tobacco addiction and disease. He was a leader in the multi-state settlement agreement that resulted in the tobacco industry paying billions of dollars to the states and changing the way it conducts business. Now Miller is working to reduce youth addiction and the death count of five thousand Iowans who die every year from tobacco-related disease.

""I consider it my duty and my privilege to be the people's lawyer,"" Miller says. ""I am deeply grateful for being able to serve as attorney general of Iowa.""",

Lawyers USA named Lori one of the top ten attorneys in America for 2009. The National Consumer Law Center awarded her the Robert Drinan “Champion of Justice” award for her consumer protection work. In 2009, she was awarded the Pro Patria Award for her support of National Guard and Reserve members. The Drum Major Institute of New York cited Lori’s predatory mortgage lending legislation as one of the ten best public policies in the country in 2007.

Attorney General Swanson’s lawsuits against insurance companies that sold unsuitable policies to senior citizens resulted in millions of dollars in refunds to consumers. She shut down the largest consumer credit arbitration company in the country after discovering that it stacked the deck against consumers and in favor of credit card companies. She has taken action against companies that sold phony health insurance policies, clinics that deceptively enrolled patients in high-interest credit cards, and hospitals that charged usurious interest. She also secured an agreement with Minnesota hospitals not to charge unfair prices to uninsured patients.

She has also taken action to provide stewardship for Minnesota’s natural resources against nuisance feedlots, invasive species, water pollution, and toxic chemicals.

Like many kids in small agricultural communities, Tim began working at a young age, and soon developed a strong work ethic thanks in part to the depression-era work ethic of his parents, Rich and Roberta Fox.

He attended Hardin public schools, and graduated from Hardin High School, and the University of Montana with degrees in geology (1981) and law (1987). A standout athlete in high school and college, and an amateur athlete after college, Tim knows how to set and achieve goals, how to lead, and how to be a team player.

After serving as a law clerk to Associate Justice L.C. Gulbrandson of the Montana Supreme Court, Tim began practicing law with the Billings, Montana law firm of Moulton, Bellingham & Longo in 1988. He first entered public service in 1990 when recruited to develop a new environmental regulatory program for the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation. After three years as a State of Montana employee, he established a solo law firm in Billings where he served as a contract public defender for the City of Billings practicing criminal law, in addition to maintaining a civil law practice. Tim and his family moved to Helena, Montana in 1995 to assist then Governor Marc Racicot in his bid for reelection. Shortly after arriving in Helena, he went to work for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality as a Special Assistant Attorney General. In 1998, Tim was promoted to a Division Administrator management position with the DEQ where he managed people, programs, and budgets for the people of Montana. In 1999, Tim was hired as Vice-President and Legal Counsel for a Helena-based national bank, Mountain West Bank. He served in that position for over four years before re-entering private practice with the law firm of Gough, Shanahan, Johnson and Waterman, PLLP

In his 25 years of experience as a Montana attorney, Tim has litigated numerous complex cases for individual Montanans and Montana businesses. Like many dedicated Montana attorneys, Tim devotes considerable time to providing pro bono legal services to Montanans who cannot afford an attorney, and to charitable and faith-based organizations. In one recent case, Tim helped the Alliance Defense Fund defend an East Helena Baptist church and its Pastor when the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices prosecuted the Church and its Pastor for speaking about Biblical truth from the pulpit. That case went all the way up to the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals where the Church and Pastor’s First Amendment Rights were vindicated. In another Constitutional rights case, Tim represented the Goldwater Institute in fighting the Federal Government’s efforts to invalidate one of Montana’s gun rights laws. Tim is a staunch advocate of our right to keep and bear arms under the Montana and United States Constitution. As a business, real estate, constitutional, environmental and commercial law attorney, Tim knows and understands the challenges that large and small Montana businesses face in a competitive market with layers of government regulations and taxes.

Tim’s parents were tireless community leaders. Growing up, Tim and his brothers learned that service to others, particularly the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised, was both gratifying and necessary to the success of democracy in America. Through the years, Tim has served in leadership positions on the board of directors of low income and disabled housing projects in Billings, two Montana symphony orchestras (Billings and Helena), a faith-based private K-12 school, the Carroll College Saints Athletic Association, and the Florence Crittenton Home, among other charitable and faith-based organizations. As a member of the Board of Delegates of the University of Montana Alumni Association, Tim strives to improve the quality of Montana’s secondary education institutions. Tim also donates his time, money, and travel expenses to college athletic programs throughout the Northwest as a nationally-certified track and field official, and coaches track & field at Carroll College in Helena. Tim is dedicated to improving the lives of young people throughout Montana by investing his time, talent, and energy in many youth programs. Tim was also appointed by Governor Marc Racicot to serve on the board of directors of the Montana Historical Society, and by Governor Judy Martz to serve on the Montana State Banking Board.

Tim’s brothers are Dr. Richard A. Fox, Jr. a retired University of South Dakota professor, Mike Fox, a retired National Park Service employee, Steve Fox, a retired Montana public high school teacher, and Dennis Fox who manages the family business in the Hardin area. Tim is married to the former Karen Wagner of Idaho Falls, Idaho, and together they have four children – Anna McMahon, Michael McMahon, Laura McMahon, and Caroline Fox – and one grandchild, Grace Olivia Emmert.",

Schneiderman was elected the 65th attorney general of New York state on Nov. 2, 2010. As attorney general, Schneiderman is the highest ranking law enforcement officer for the state, responsible for representing New York and its residents in legal matters. Schneiderman has worked to restore the public’s faith in its public and private sector institutions by focusing on areas including public integrity, economic justice, social justice and environmental protection.

In his first weeks in office, Attorney General Schneiderman launched a new ""Taxpayer Protection Bureau"" to root out fraud and return money illegally stolen from New York taxpayers at no additional cost to the state, an initiative which has yielded significant returns to date, as a result of its investigations. He has also bolstered the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, which has already recovered tens of millions of dollars for taxpayers on his watch. As part of his effort to crack down on corruption and restore the public’s trust in government, Schneiderman launched a groundbreaking initiative expanding his office’s authority to investigate public corruption involving taxpayer funds by partnering with the state Comptroller. In addition, the Attorney General appointed public integrity officers in every region of the state to give New Yorkers a place to go to report complaints of government corruption without the fear of local politics influencing the outcome.

A hallmark of Attorney General Schneiderman’s tenure has been standing up to powerful interests on behalf of everyday New Yorkers. The attorney general has taken a leading role in the national fight for a comprehensive investigation of misconduct in the mortgage market, and for a fair settlement for homeowners that holds banks accountable for their role in the foreclosure crisis, provides meaningful relief to homeowners and investors, and allows a full airing out of the facts to ensure that abuses of this scale never happen again.

In addition, in his first year in office Attorney General Schneiderman has filed a legal challenge to the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to compel the federal government to treat all New York State marriages equally; joined a Justice Department lawsuit to block AT&T’s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile because it would violate federal antitrust laws and damage competition in both New York and national wireless markets; sued federal regulators to force a health and environmental impact review of proposed gas drilling in the Delaware River Basin; and challenged the Indian Point nuclear power plant’s practices related to high-level radioactive waste storage, earthquake preparedness and fire safety, to name a few of the office's many acts on behalf of New Yorkers. Attorney General Schneiderman has also kept our streets safe by shutting down multiple statewide narcotics rings, including the largest heroin operation in Buffalo history – a statewide drug trafficking pipeline from New York City to Western New York.

As the state’s top law enforcement officer, Attorney General Schneiderman brings with him a wealth of experience, in both the public and private sectors. Before becoming attorney general, Schneiderman was praised as a leading reformer in the state Senate by numerous editorial pages and good government organizations across New York. Among his many legislative accomplishments, Schneiderman passed sweeping ethics reforms, chaired the committee to expel a corrupt senator for the first time in modern history, led the effort to reform the draconian Rockefeller drug laws, cracked down on health insurance companies seeking to deny coverage to vulnerable New Yorkers, and enacted the toughest law in the nation to root out fraud against taxpayers.

The attorney general previously spent 15 years in private practice as an attorney, and later as a partner, at the firm of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart, where he handled complex litigation. He was also a public interest lawyer for many years, representing taxpayers in historic lawsuits against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), tenants trying to evict drug dealers from their buildings, and women seeking access to health clinics.

had seen violent offenders get off with light sentences. Out of that
experience, he changed the law to add extra-time for those who use a gun to
commit a crime. He continued to protect victims through his work in the U.S
Congress, where he received numerous awards from victim rights organizations.
And, as Ohio lieutenant governor, DeWine worked to reform our parole system so
that violent offenders remained locked up.

In the U.S. Senate, I promoted the emerging DNA technology, establishing and expanding a truly national database for DNA, fingerprint, and ballistics information, so that violent offenders -- no matter where they traveled -- could be caught and
prosecuted.” DeWine specifically targeted funds to Ohio’s crime lab -- the
Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation -- to keep our families
safer.

While others were on the sidelines, Mike DeWine has, for over 30 years, fought to
protect the unborn. He was one of a handful of U.S. senators to lead the charge
to ban the horrific partial-birth abortion practice. DeWine wrote and pushed
for passage of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which for the first time,
created a federal law recognizing that an unborn child is a separate victim
when the mother is attacked. And, he wrote the “DeWine Amendment” each Congress to prohibit federal tax dollars from being used to pay for insurance to provide abortion coverage.

Michael DeWine was born on Jan. 5, 1947, in Springfield, Ohio, and grew up in Yellow Springs. He married his high school sweetheart Frances Struewing while both
were students at Miami University. After graduating from Miami, DeWine attended

As a native Rhode Islander, Attorney General Kilmartin grew up in the city of Pawtucket where he attended neighborhood public schools. His mother and father taught him, as well as his three brothers, the importance of honesty, community and hard work at an early age.

After graduating from Tolman High School, Kilmartin decided that he wanted to protect and serve the community in which he grew up. In 1984, Attorney General Kilmartin enrolled in the police academy, and for 24 years, served his community as a member of the Pawtucket Police Department, starting as an officer on patrol, working his way up to becoming the officer in charge of prosecutions and retiring as a Captain.

Kilmartin earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Roger Williams University, and later earned his Juris Doctorate at Roger Williams University School of Law. 

As a police officer, Kilmartin knew that he didn’t just want to protect the public, he wanted to be their advocate. He decided to run for state representative, and at the State House he fought to further the protection of Rhode Islanders for nearly 20 years.

As a state representative, Attorney General Kilmartin helped pass laws to protect children from predators, create a witness protection program, ban texting while driving, keep alcohol out of cars, put an end to pension abuses, strengthen domestic violence penalties and force health insurance companies to cover reconstructive surgery for women following breast cancer mastectomies.

Recognizing his devotion to fighting for the protection of every day Rhode Islanders, Kilmartin received numerous public service awards from a wide array of groups, including: Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), After-School Alliance Plus, Justice Assistance, the Boys and Girls Club, Gateway Health Care and the Northern Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce.

Since being elected Attorney General, Kilmartin has continued to put Rhode Islanders’ safety and security as his number one priority. Kilmartin has strongly advocated for longer prison sentences and stiffer penalties for those who commit crimes. He successfully changed the state’s “Good Time” law, prohibiting those who commit heinous crimes against children to earn time off for good behavior while incarcerated. He has advocated for stronger stiffer sentences for those who illegally possess and use firearms, as well as those who engage in gang activity. 

Kilmartin has established specialized prosecution units that specialize in specific crimes and victims, including a Veteran’s Court with the goal of successfully rehabilitating veterans by diverting them from the traditional criminal justice system and providing them the tools they will need to lead a productive, law-abiding life. In addition, Kilmartin established a Child Abuse Unit, led by prosecutors, victim advocates and support staff, all trained to handle the emotional and psychological effects associated with physical and sexual abuse of children. He has been a leader in updating the state’s Internet safety laws, protecting children from online predators, and was the architect of the 2012 changes to the state’s Access to Public Records Act. 

Kilmartin serves in several leadership positions with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), including liaison to the International Association of Prosecutors, chair for NAAG’s Eastern Region, co-chair for NAAG’s Consumer Protection Committee, and serves on the Criminal Law Committee, the Law Enforcement and Prosecutorial Relations Working Group, and Veterans Affairs Committee.

Kilmartin and his wife, Kristine, are actively involved in the community. Together, they founded the Pawtucket Arts Festival in 1999, which draws thousands of people from all across Southern New England to Pawtucket every year, serving as an economic and cultural boon to the Rhode Island economy.",

In what has been coined a landslide victory, General Reyes received over 60 percent of the vote in the 2014 general election. On Jan. 5, 2014, at age 42, Reyes took the oath of office once again under officiator and Utah Supreme Court Associate Justice Thomas R. Lee. During his culturally diverse inauguration ceremony and speech, Reyes reaffirmed the Utah Attorney General’s Office (“AGO”) focus on returning to being a law office and not a political one; and on legal excellence, professionalism, and the AGO’s priority to defend the citizens, businesses and laws of Utah.

RESTORING PUBLIC TRUST
In just one year, Reyes has won back confidence in his office from leaders in politics, education, business, law and, most importantly, from Utah citizens. In the first months of his administration, by commissioning outside investigations and audits to shine a light on even the possibility of misconduct in the AGO, streamline budgets and expenditures, and improve infrastructure and client satisfaction, Reyes quickly reestablished credibility at the highest ranks of the office with an outstanding 90 percent client satisfaction audit result last fall. 

WIDE SPREAD SUPPORT
The AGO, under the Reyes Administration, has the support of mayors, councilmen and commissioners state wide and critical law enforcement relationships have been repaired with sheriffs, police chiefs and federal partners like ICE and the DEA. Among his peers in the legal community, Reyes has been applauded by county attorneys, judges and lawyers for focusing his office on the rule of law and not political agendas or special interests. 

CASES OF NATIONAL INTEREST
At the time of his first inauguration, several cases of national interest, including those regarding the definition of marriage, polygamy and immigration were awaiting his direction and leadership. While very emotional and potentially divisive in nature, Reyes has approached each case with the same sense of dignity, professionalism, exceptionalism, duty and respect that won him numerous awards and recognitions throughout his legal career including being named first-ever National Outstanding Young Lawyer by the ABA, a distinction bestowed on one lawyer out of millions nationwide. Along with many upgrades to infrastructure, technology and efficiencies to make his legal teams even better, he organized a Constitutional Law Section to support the Utah AGO with many of the critical issues it has already faced and is likely to face in the near future. 

POLITICAL SERVICE AT ALL LEVELS
In addition to his legal career and volunteer service, Reyes has been very involved in Utah politics. He has served as a county, state and national delegate for the Republican Party and a member of the State Central Committee (the governing body of the Utah Republican Party). He served several terms as a leader in his local precinct and was appointed by Governor John M. Huntsman and re-appointed by Governor Gary R. Herbert to serve as one of the youngest members of the prestigious Third District Judicial Nominating Commission. He spent several years on a National Congressional Commission started by President George W. Bush. Appointed by Congress and the president of the United States, Reyes conducted public hearings throughout the country to advise the Administration and Congress on Latino issues, including a National Museum of the American Latino.

FAMILY MATTERS
Reyes and his wife, Saysha, are the proud parents of six children between the ages of four and 16. In his free time, he enjoys playing morning basketball, coaching his kids in youth football, baseball, basketball, volleyball and soccer, taking walks or doing anything with Saysha, watching Sports Center, attending and speaking at Comic Cons, as well as cooking, shooting guns and watching mixed martial arts (now that his fighting days are over).",
