# U.S. State Attorneys General

Hand-pulled (and scraped) public data on U.S. State Attorneys General

*Notes:*
- The JSON file is treated as the master list, hand-edited with the CSV and YAML generated from it
- Twitter handle for the A.G. public identity is included where one could be found
- If their Twitter handle seemed inactive, or belonged to an old campaign, and an account belonging to the state office of the A.G was available (@AGmyState), that was included instead
- If the A.G. appeared to have two accounts, one personal (@JoeSmithRadDad) and one pertaining to their role as A.G. (@JoeSmithCalAG), the latter was used
- If the A.G. had two active accounts, both professional, the most recently updated one was used
