Hand-pulled public data on U.S. State Attorneys General

*Notes:*
- Twitter handle for the A.G. public identity is included where one could be found
- If their Twitter handle seemed inactive, or belonged to an old campaign, and an account belonging to the state office of the A.G was available, that was included instead
- If the A.G. appeared to have two accounts, one personal (@JoeSmithRadDad) and one pertaining to their role as A.G. (@JoeSmithCalAG), the latter was used
